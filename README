------=== NCSSBot ===------

NCSSBot is a collaboration between AClockWorkLemon and George1024 to create a Python IRC bot with some extensive features.
It originally started out as two separate bots, George1024's ChallengeBot, which polled the NCSS Challenge Leaderboards and poseted any changes, and mine, MarvinBot, which used a modular command structure to allow more commands to be added and old ones to be edited with ease.
NCSSBot tries to combine these two principles, among others, to create a Multi-threaded IRC bot, wich is controllable through the command line, has website polling capabilities, and a module-based command system.
